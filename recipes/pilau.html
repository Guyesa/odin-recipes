    </ul>

    </ul>
    <h3>STEPS</h3>
    <ol>
     <li>Rinse the rice thoroughly under cold water until the water runs clear. Drain and set aside.</li>
     <li>In a large pot or pan, heat the cooking oil or ghee over medium heat.</li>
     <li>Add the whole spices: cumin seeds, whole black peppercorns, cloves, green cardamom pods, and cinnamon sticks. Sauté for a minute or until fragrant.</li>
     <li>Add the chopped onions and cook until they turn soft and golden brown.</li>
     <li>Stir in the minced garlic and ginger paste. Sauté for a minute until aromatic.</li>
     <li>Add the meat pieces to the pot. Brown the meat on all sides.</li>
     <li>Mix in the ground spices: turmeric, ground cumin, ground coriander, and paprika or cayenne pepper. Ensure the meat is coated with the spices.</li>
     <li>Add the chopped tomatoes and diced bell peppers. Cook until the tomatoes break down and the peppers soften.</li>
     <li>Pour in the warm water or broth. Add salt to taste. Bring the mixture to a simmer.</li>
     <li>Add the rice to the pot, distributing it evenly among the ingredients. Stir gently.</li>
     <li>If using raisins or currants, sprinkle them over the rice for a touch of sweetness.</li>
     <li>Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid. Reduce the heat to low and let the pilau simmer for about 20-25 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and the liquid is absorbed.</li>
     <li>Once the rice is cooked, remove the pot from heat and let it sit, covered, for about 10 minutes. This helps the flavors meld and the rice to settle.</li>
     <li>Fluff the rice gently with a fork to separate the grains.</li>
     <li>Serve the Swahili Pilau hot, garnished with chopped cilantro or parsley. Optionally, top with fried onions and nuts for added texture and flavor.</li>

     <p>Swahili Pilau is a delightful dish that combines fragrant spices with tender meat and flavorful rice. Enjoy this beloved East African recipe with friends and family!</p>
