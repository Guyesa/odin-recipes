    <h3>STEPS</h3>
    <h4>Preparing Beef Stew</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot, heat cooking oil over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped onions and sauté until they become translucent.</li>
        <li>Stir in the minced garlic and ginger (if using) and cook for another minute until aromatic.</li>
        <li>Add the beef pieces to the pot and brown them on all sides.</li>
        <li>Once the beef is browned, add your chosen spices (such as curry powder, paprika, cumin, etc.). Stir to coat the beef with the spices.</li>
        <li>Pour in the diced tomatoes and allow them to cook down, releasing their juices.</li>
        <li>Add sliced carrots and diced potatoes to the pot. Mix well to incorporate the vegetables with the beef and spices.</li>
        <li>Pour in enough beef or vegetable broth to cover the ingredients in the pot. If needed, you can also add a bit of water to ensure everything is submerged.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper according to your taste.</li>
        <li>Cover the pot and let the stew simmer on low to medium heat. The cooking time will depend on the type of beef and the size of the pieces. Simmer until the beef is tender and the vegetables are cooked through.</li>
        <li>About halfway through the cooking time, add the diced green bell peppers. This will add a fresh burst of flavor and color to the stew.</li>
        <li>Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. You can also add more water or broth if the stew is becoming too thick.</li>
        <li>Once the beef is tender and the flavors have melded together, remove the pot from the heat.</li>
        <li>Serve the Ugali Beef Stew hot, garnished with fresh herbs like cilantro or parsley if desired.</li>
        <li>This hearty and comforting dish pairs wonderfully with a side of ugali (maize porridge) or your choice of starch.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Preparing Ugali</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a separate pot, bring 4 cups of water to a boil.</li>
        <li>While the water is heating, mix the maize flour with about 1 cup of cold water in a separate bowl. Stir well to make a smooth paste, ensuring there are no lumps.</li>
        <li>When the water comes to a boil, reduce the heat to low and slowly pour in the maize flour paste while continuously stirring with a wooden spoon or a spatula.</li>
        <li>Keep stirring the mixture to prevent lumps from forming. It should start to thicken quickly as the maize flour cooks and absorbs the water.</li>
        <li>Continue stirring and cooking the mixture for about 5-10 minutes until it reaches a thick, dough-like consistency. The ugali should easily come away from the sides of the pot.</li>
        <li>Once the ugali is cooked, remove it from the heat.</li>
        <li>Let the ugali sit for a minute to cool slightly, then wet your hands with water to prevent sticking and shape the ugali into a round mound or individual portions.</li>
        <li>Serve the freshly cooked ugali alongside the beef stew.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Enjoy your delicious and flavorful Ugali Beef Stew, a wholesome dish that embodies the richness of East African cuisine!</p>
